As a soon to be Biomedical Engineering grad on the hunt for my first real internship, I’ve been reflecting on how much of this journey isn’t visible in a resume or a LinkedIn update. Sure, I’ve got a few cool projects and a handful of polished reports to show—but that’s only 1% of the story.

The other 99%? That’s the late nights troubleshooting code that *almost* worked, the circuits that overheated (twice), and the designs that never made it out of the simulation phase. It’s all still in my notebooks, sketches, and folders labeled “v4_final_revised_FINAL_final2”. And honestly? I wouldn’t trade it for anything.


## The Beauty of What Didn’t Work

In BME, so much of what we do is trial and (a lot of) error. But every “failure” taught me something new—about the tech, about the process, and about myself.

Those scrapped ideas weren’t wasted time—they were tiny masterclasses in problem-solving.


## Learning by Leaving Things Behind

The weirdest thing about engineering school? The first idea is rarely the one that works. You think, “Yeah this makes sense,” and then a TA or lab partner (or physics) proves otherwise. So you iterate. You test. You adapt.

And in the process, you become a little more resilient and a lot more curious. That process of narrowing down ideas—of saying “not this one, not yet”—is what *built* me as an engineer.


## My Drawer = My Superpower

I’ve got folders full of projects that didn’t “succeed” in the traditional sense. But they’re a goldmine of ideas. Sometimes I revisit an old design and realize it just needed a better sensor. Or that I understand the problem more clearly now than I did a year ago.

Those unused projects? They’ve taught me *how* to think, not just *what* to build.


## The Failures That Will Fuel the Future

One of my professors used to say, “A goldmine is hiding in your failed lab reports.” At the time, I thought he was joking. But now I get it.

A design that didn’t quite work for cardiac monitoring might be perfect for sleep tracking. A sensor setup that was too bulky for wearables could be ideal for rehab tech. Nothing is really wasted in this field—it's all just waiting for the right problem to solve.

## Final Thoughts (and a Shameless Internship Plug)

So here’s to the 99%—the scribbles, the bug fixes, the “back to the drawing board” moments. That’s where the real learning lives. That’s the version of me that’s excited to bring all of that raw, messy, hands-on experience to a team where I can keep learning, keep failing (productively), and start building things that matter.

If you’re looking for an enthusiastic, caffeine-powered, and curiosity-driven intern who knows his way around sensors, circuits, and the chaos of early prototyping—let’s chat. My drawer is open, and it’s got some interesting stuff in it.
